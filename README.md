# Vibers — Bielik solves the Polish history matura

Team **Vibers**, Warsaw Model Trainers hackathon (Kolektyw3, 25–27.09.2026). See `SOURCE.md`.

An offline system that takes the organizers' exam pack (`exam.json` + PNG images) and writes `answers.json` for the
CKE history matura (poziom rozszerzony, formula 2023, 60 points). One open model answers everything:
**Bielik-4.5B-v3.0-Instruct Q8_0**, the untouched registered base, no adapter. Around it:

- a retrieval harness over the whole Polish Wikipedia (BM25 + bge-reranker-v2-m3) that writes the **essay**
  (plan → retrieval per topic element → paragraphs → conclusion → fact check against the retrieved passages);
- one open vision model, **Qwen3.5-9B**, whose only job is to turn exam images into Polish text descriptions.
  Bielik never sees pixels.

Nothing calls a closed API at exam time; the whole run is local (llama.cpp) and fits one L40S.

## Final configuration (26.09 evening)

| Part | What runs |
|---|---|
| Short items (multiple choice, true/false, matching, open answers, "rozstrzygnij") | Bielik directly (`exam_runner --mode hybrid` → raw), temperature 0 |
| Essay (item 26) | harness v3 (`CKE_MODE=1 QTYPE_V2=1 RERANK=1 ESSAY_SAFE=1`): retrieval per topic element, years only (≤ 2 per paragraph), strict date verification against the retrieved passages, best of two topics by unsupported-claim count |
| Images | Qwen3.5-9B Q5_K_M + mmproj F16, "literal" prompt (what is visible, every label/legend/inscription verbatim, "nieczytelne" instead of guessing); the description is inserted into the item text with a note that it is machine-written and may contain errors, and it is kept out of retrieval queries |
| Serving | llama.cpp b11185, `-np 1` (one sequence at a time, repeatable output), `--cache-ram 0` |

Why this split: on CKE papers we did not tune on, the harness helped only the essay; on short items raw Bielik was as
good or better (details in `docs/final_config.md`).

**For the final day:** `FINAL_RUNBOOK.md` (step-by-step, Polish) and `PRESENTATION.md` (talking points).
**Weights and the prebuilt knowledge base:** https://huggingface.co/zeemowo/vibers-wmt-matura (exact files we run, sha256-pinned) — `scripts/download_models.sh` fetches and verifies everything.

## Run the final

```bash
scripts/run_final.sh PKG_DIR [OUT_DIR]      # PKG_DIR = exam.json + answers-template.json + images/
```
It starts the vision server, describes every image, stops it, starts the reranker + Bielik + harness, answers all
items, validates the file against the template and prints the `answers.json` path. A full run of the 2023 mock takes
about 3.5 minutes on an L40S. Paths and ports are env-overridable (see the header of the script).

The untouched base benchmark on the same pack (the organizers compute progress against it): `scripts/run_final_base.sh PKG_DIR [OUT_DIR]`.

Prerequisites (all offline once downloaded; `scripts/download_models.sh` gets the four model files and the index from Hugging Face):

| Component | File | Source | License |
|---|---|---|---|
| Answering model | `Bielik-4.5B-v3.0-Instruct.Q8_0.gguf` (5.06 GB, sha256 `562f2291de257890adf2b4a914da8b194affe6a7a838a6b7ef3d342f306c1b7f`) | speakleash/Bielik-4.5B-v3.0-Instruct-GGUF | Apache-2.0 |
| Vision model | `Qwen3.5-9B-Q5_K_M.gguf` + `mmproj-F16.gguf` (7.50 GB together) | unsloth/Qwen3.5-9B-GGUF | Apache-2.0 |
| Reranker | `bge-reranker-v2-m3-Q8_0.gguf` | BAAI/bge-reranker-v2-m3 (GGUF) | Apache-2.0 |
| Knowledge base | BM25 index over plwiki CirrusSearch dump 2025-12-29 (3,446,110 chunks, 5.4 GB) | prebuilt in zeemowo/vibers-wmt-matura `kb_index/`, or rebuild with `kb/run_all.sh` | CC BY-SA 4.0 (Wikipedia) |
| Runtime | llama.cpp b11185 (CUDA), Python 3.12 + `docker/requirements.txt` | ggml-org/llama.cpp | MIT |

Every model is ≤ 8 GB. Exact files, revisions and checksums of the vision candidates: `docs/vlm_candidates_manifest.json`.
Docker packaging (optional): `docker/README.md`.

## Results

All scores are CKE-rubric grades from independent Claude Opus examiners (blind, labels shuffled per examiner and item;
3 examiners where marked). The base is the untouched Bielik answering directly.

| Benchmark | Base (raw Bielik) | Final system | Gain |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12 essays, formula 2023 (Dec 2022 – Jan 2026 papers), 3 examiners, median | 1.7 / 15 | **6.2 / 15** (`ESSAY_SAFE=1`; the earlier pipeline 4.75–4.9) | **≈ +4.5 per exam** |
| Short items of 4 CKE papers (2023–2026, 126 pts) | 70 / 126 (56%) | same answers (raw Bielik) | 0 |
| Organizers' mock (CKE May 2023, 60 pts, final conditions: PNGs only) | 24–25 / 60 | 25–27 / 60 (two runs) | +1 to +3 |

Honest reading: the gain is real but small and comes entirely from the essay. Our wider experiments (harness v3/v4 for
all items, LoRA on Claude-verified short answers, LoRA v3 via rejection sampling on Bielik's own correct reasoning) did not
beat raw Bielik on held-out papers and are therefore not in the final; the reports are in `docs/`.

## Repository map

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `harness/` | FastAPI answer server (`python -m harness`), CKE flows (`cke_flow.py`, `cke_essay.py`), `exam_runner.py` (official exam pack → `answers.json`, modes raw / harness / hybrid) |
| `kb/` | Polish Wikipedia knowledge base: dump download, chunking, BM25 index, search, dense/hybrid experiments |
| `scripts/` | `run_final.sh`, `describe_images.py` (vision model → descriptions), L40S helpers, data fetch scripts |
| `devset/` | our dev sets (questions generated by Claude from Wikipedia, verified), `eval.py`; CKE-derived sets are not committed |
| `train/` | LoRA experiments (SFT from verified short answers, RFT v3); not used by the final |
| `docs/` | evaluation reports and decisions (Polish): `final_config.md`, `mock_opus_panel.md`, `cke_v3_lora_eval.md`, `vision_describer_eval.md`, `error_map_v2.md`, ... |
| `docker/` | offline production packaging |
| `panel/` | web panel for watching experiment results |
| `tests/` | unit tests (`python -m pytest tests`) |

## Data and AI use

- **Knowledge at exam time:** Polish Wikipedia only (CC BY-SA 4.0).
- **CKE materials** (past papers, keys, the 660 versions for blind students) were used only to evaluate. They are
  copyrighted and are **not** in this repository; `scripts/fetch_cke.py` and `scripts/fetch_arkusze.py` download them
  from the public CKE/OKE sites.
- **Generated data:** dev/training questions were generated and verified by Claude models (Anthropic) from Wikipedia and
  ZPE texts; training targets were short canonical answers, the model's own outputs or official CKE sample solutions.
- **Development:** Claude (Claude Code) was used as a coding agent and as the blind examiner for evaluation. No closed
  model is called while the exam runs.
